# Dotfiles

My zsh settings. I just want to type less.

## Installation
Clone the repo anywhere you want. I cloned it on `~/Sites`.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jonathantorres/dotfiles.git
```

Copy my zsh settings file.
```bash
cp ~/.zshrc ~/Sites/dotfiles/.zshrc
```

Copy my custom folder. Here I can store my plugins and my aliases.
```bash
cp -R ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/ ~/Sites/dotfiles/.oh-my-zsh/custom/
```
